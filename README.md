**TO RUN THE PROGRAM FOLLOWING STEPS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED::**
1. After extracting the zip file there will be three folders (code and header files (LMS),
Library Management and Main program) and first you must save the folder named
“Library Management” to your respective C drive(C:\). This contains all the data required
during the execution of the application(data of books, data of issued books, and the
password required to log-in as librarian).
2. Extract libray_mang folder in you Library Management Software folder.
3. Then open the “main program” folder which contains a program file named
“library_mang.exe” by opening it you can access the gui based LIBRARY
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM console.

**TO RUN THE CODE DIRECTLY::**
1. First install the Visual Studio 2019 community version (Link:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. After downloading you have to extract the zip file named “Project” and you will get a
folder named “Projects”.
3. Open the Visual Studio 2019 and click on Open a project or solution menu. It will redirect
you to open the solution file. And then redirect yourself to the extracted folder and open
the “library_mang.sln” file. It will open all the necessary header files, and the code.
4. Change the Solution Configuration to Release and click Ctrl + F5 to run the code without
debugging. It will execute all the code and will open the application.
5. In the solution explorer tab, you can see all the header files with code.
TO VIEW THE CODE ONLY::
1. If you wish to view the code of the program open folder “code and header files (LMS)”.
2. Then go to a folder named “library_mang” where you can find all the code and header
files related to the screens/windows of gui.
3. When you open the gui application, you can see the name of the code/header file
belonging to that screen/window at the upper-left corner of the screen.

**TO DELETE ALL THE FILES::**
If you want to delete all the files make sure you remove this app’s background process. To do so:
1. Open task manager by pressing ctrl+shift+esc.
2. After then scroll down to background processes and find library_mang, then select this
file and click end task.
